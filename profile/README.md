# Hello World!

This is team Spartans. We formed the team in late 2018. The product name is called **UNOPLAT**.

## Vision

The vision of the unoplat is to bootstrap entire backend cloud native infrastructure. The backend infra also is going to be based out of fundamentals of data mesh where we look beyond data lake and warehouses. 

## Metrics of Success

* Time to Value for any feature/product
* To enable data driven use cases by at least order of magnitude faster through uno data mesh.
* Reduce Operating Cost by at least an order of magnitude.

## Approach

Based on the metrics of success we knew one thing - We had to build the foundation for any cloud-native/hybrid product in any domain. We call this foundation **Unoplat.ai.**.

## Identification of cross cutting concerns

The task at hand was to determine the repetitive tasks present in sdlc of any cloud-native/hybrid product of any domain in order to arrive at scope of the **unoplat.ai**.

We kept the research based on first principles. After multiple case studies and talking to multiple engineering leaders across different products we arrived at the cross-cutting concerns mentioned below:

* [Uno Developer Joy](https://github.com/spartansdataplatform/.github/wiki/Developer-Joy)
* Uno App Fabric
* Uno Data Mesh
* Uno MLOps
