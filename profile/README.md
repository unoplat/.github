# Hello World!

This is team Spartans. We formed the team in late 2018. The product name is called **UNOPLAT**.

## Vision

The vision of the unoplat is to bootstrap entire backend cloud native infrastructure. This in fact is going to be an open source alternative to Databricks lake house platform and is going to be a better one as the platform will be centred around Data Mesh empowering organizations in their data vision. 

## Metrics of Success

* Time to Value for any feature/product
* To enable data driven use cases by at least order of magnitude faster through uno data mesh.
* Reduce Operating Cost by at least an order of magnitude.

## Approach

Based on the metrics of success we knew one thing - We had to build the foundation for any cloud-native/hybrid product in any domain. We call this foundation **Unoplat.ai.**.

## Identification of cross cutting concerns

The task at hand was to determine the repetitive tasks present in sdlc of any cloud-native/hybrid product of any domain in order to arrive at scope of the **unoplat.ai**.

We kept the research based on first principles. After multiple case studies and talking to multiple engineering leaders across different products we arrived at the cross-cutting concerns mentioned below:

* [Uno Developer Joy](https://github.com/spartansdataplatform/.github/wiki/Developer-Joy)
* Uno App Fabric
* Uno Data Mesh
* Uno MLOps
