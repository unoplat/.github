# Hello World!

We formed the team in late 2018. The product name is called UNOPLAT.

## Vision

The vision of the unoplat is to bootstrap Cloud native Data platform.

## Metrics of Success

* Time to Value for any feature/product
* To enable data driven use cases by at least an order of magnitude faster through uno data mesh.
* Reduce Operating Cost by at least an order of magnitude.
* Developer Experience

## Approach

Based on the metrics of success, we had to build the foundation for any cloud-native product in any domain. We call this foundation Unoplat.ai.
After multiple case studies and developing backend infra/services for various engineering leaders, we arrived at these cross-cutting concerns:

1. Uno Developer Joy
2. Uno App and Infra Fabric
3. Uno Data Mesh
4. Uno MLOps

### Uno Developer Joy

#### What is Developer joy?

Developer joy stems from keeping developers happy and productive by shielding them from daily chaos, inspired by Spotify's backstage insights. It addresses pain points like unnecessary cognitive load from interacting with multiple tools and slow feedback loops.

#### Why is it needed?

Developers face many day-to-day operations, such as figuring out best frameworks for the task assigned, version control, devsecops, IAM, monitoring tools, etc. Navigating multiple portals creates cognitive load, hindering productivity and creativity. Feedback loops for commit quality are slow, impacting product timelines.

#### How teams could achieve Developer Joy?

By adopting a Kubernetes-like approach for developers, providing a single interface with reusable code, devsecops, monitoring, alerting, infra, and docs. Implementing precommit CI/CD ensures instant feedback on code quality, security, and tests before committing.

#### How does **UNOPLAT** solve this problem?

UnoPlatform is an opinionated platform in terms of its selection of tools and as of now the platform relies on:
1.  **Spotify Backstage.** - Single pane of glass for devs.
2.  **tilt** - Precommit CI/CD
3. **Unoplat Cli**  - To Interact with Unoplat ecosystem

## Impact on business/Organisation

* Supercharged Development experience resulting in exponential reduction in time to value for shipping products/features and happy devs.
* Seamless collaboration with multiple devs across multiple product teams.
* Happier Devs resulting in lesser attrition.
* Exponential reduction in operating cost in using multiple tools to keep track of the project.
